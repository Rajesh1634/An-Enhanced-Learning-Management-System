            <p>
                Professor JD has lots of options. Bottles containing all types of potions are stacked on shelves which cover the entire wall from floor to ceiling. 
    
                Professor JD has broken his bones several times while climbing the top shelf for retrieving a potion. He decided to get a ladder for him. 
                
                But he has no time to visit Charu. So he instructed Bargav to make a ladder for him. Professor JD specifically wants a step ladder that looks like an inverted 'V' from a side view.
                
                Professor just mentioned two things before vanishing-
                
                B - separation between left side (LS) and right side (RS) on the ground
                
                LS - the length of left side
                
                What should be the length of RS? At one extreme LS can be vertical and at other RS can be vertical. 
                
                Bargav is angry and confused. 
                
                 Can you help him find the minimum and maximum length of RS.

                Ramesh is working in an engineering college hostel as a Mess supervisor. There are different messes are available based on the years. 
    
    Every day students count is varying in all the hostels due to continuous holidays.
    
    Since ramesh is in charge of the cooking team. He had trouble with calculating the quantity of food that needs to be prepared because of the varying student count.
    
    Even if a small quantity of food is prepared by the cooking team, it should be divided equally among the number of Mess.Ramesh needs an automated software to identify the amount of food available (in number of packets ) and Mess count. 
    
    Can you help him to divide the food equally and also calculating the remaining quantity of food that will be available after sharing the food equally ?

                Binita is playing a chess. The game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of N rows and M columns. Initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored.
    
    Binita's initial score is zero. At each turn, he chooses some cell that is yet not colored, and colors that cell. The score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that Binita colored in this step. 
    
    Two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them. The game will end when all the cells are colored. Finally, total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn.
    
    Binita wants to know what maximum score he can get? Can you please help him in finding this out?

                Nathan works as an HR in a private company. He had an opportunity to interview students from various disciplines. 
    
                He asked the candidates to perform the addition of two floating point numbers given by him an to print the output with three values after decimal point. But the student failed a math test on adding two numbers. So many students could not complete the first round. 
                
                One day Nathan is invited as a chief placement trainer in a reputed engineering college. He willing to know how many students are capable of solving the same problem.
                
                Can you solve the problem and prove him that you are capable of solving it?

                Elavenil has a chessboard with N rows and M columns. In one step, he can choose two cells of the chessboard which share a common edge (that has not been cut yet) and cut this edge.
    
    Formally, the chessboard is split into two or more pieces if it is possible to partition its cells into two non-empty subsets S1 and S2 (S1∩S2=∅, |S1|+|S2|=NM) such that there is no pair of cells c1,c2 (c1∈S1,c2∈S2) which share a common edge that has not been cut.
    
    Elavenil does not want the board to split into two or more pieces. Compute the maximum number of steps he can perform while satisfying this condition.

                Laasya bought a new volleyball in the sports shop. It looks like a medium size. 
    
    She somehow found the radius of the sphere.
    
    But she would like to know the volume of that ball. 
    
    Can you help him in finding the Volume of the ball? 
    
    Functional Description:
    
    Volume = (4.0/3.0) × π × r^3 
    π = 3.14
