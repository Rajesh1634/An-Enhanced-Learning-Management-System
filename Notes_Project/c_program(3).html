                He has a m x n units of floor area and want to cover it up with 2x1 size tiles. 
                
                Krishna is no so good at calculations. 
                
                Could you help him to find out the minimum number tiles he needs to cover the floor?

                The car mechanic estimated a time in seconds which will be taken to construct a race car,But the professionals in Ford wanted the exact time in D:HH:MM:SS, (where D, HH, MM, and SS represent days, hours, minutes and seconds respectively) to be convinced for funding. 
                
                Help them with a suitable logic that can help the car mechanic to convince Ford company.

    After a month long travel they have collected lakh's of people data from the eastern states of India.
    
    Now Vinod need to extract the last two digits of the people's year from the data they have for documentation purpose.
    
    Since the samples are in huge numbers  it is difficult for Vinod to single handly do that.

                Yasir was making a kite.His sister Athika said that she can print the frame of the kite using biodegradable material and a 3D printer .
    
                The shape of the frame is simple in the top it is triangle between the triangles mid point there comes a straight thicker line which extends upto the bottom.
                
                Once printed a sheet of paper can be used to cover the frame. Athika made the frame using the 3d printer and asked Yasir to buy a sheet of paper .
                
                But Yasir wants to know the exact area covered by the top triangle of the frame. 
                
                Athika had the dimensions fed in her laptop help her to compute the area of the triangle using the 3 sides.

                Madhan was working as a loco pilot in the Indian railways. 
    
    He was traveling from one state to another state by train. 
    
    The default distance calculation machine shows the total traveling distance in kilometres.
    
    But Madhan would like to know the distance in Meters, Feet, Inches, Centimeters
    
    Can you provide him the distance in as he requests?

                ArulMozhivarman and his wife Yazhini loves to travel around the world. As a part of their epic journey they together spent 1 year in various states of United States and after 1 year they traveled to Canada.
    
    Usually in United States fuel efficiency for vehicles is normally expressed in MilesPer Gallon(MPG).
    
    But in Canada, fuel efficiency is normally expressed in Liters Per Hundred Kilometers (L/100 km).
    
    ArulMozhivarman and his wife Yazhini were little bit confused in calculating the fuel efficiency of the vechicles they for their daily travels and they feel if there is portal for converting the fuel efficiency in  MPG to L/100 km then their life will be much more easier.
    
    Can you help them with the fuel efficiency conversion portal so that they can enjoy their time together without working about the fuel efficiency of their vehicles?
