                Sajid loves super heroes he used to imagine himself to be a hero.
        
        One day his teacher was taking a class about shapes and asked the students to find the Area of the triangle using Heron's formula. 
        
        Sajid misheard this as Hero's formula and was curious to discover the Hero's formula for finding the area of the triangle.

                Salima saw a pair of beautiful dress online but she was confused about the metric system used for the size of the dress. 
        
                It was given in feet and inches, even in some countries that primarily use some other metric system.
                
                As Salima knows a little bit of programming she thought of creating a program that gets number of feet and inches  and compute the height of the customer in centimeters.

        Roopa and Atifa are sisters they love to compete by playing math games which gradually helped them in their academics one day.
        
        Roopa gave her a math puzzle to her sister.
        
        The puzzle involves two decimal numbers.
        
        Atifa just had add the two floating point numbers but the twist is Atifa should only add the integer part of the decimal number.
        
        But Atifa thought she can code a program for the puzzle  but she is finding it difficult.
        
        Can you help her with the suitable logic?

                Arif planned to make a room cleaning robot for his college mini project competition.
        
                First he has to code program to simulate the robot movements inside the room.
                
                He measured the length and width of the room.
                
                Once the values are available, his program should compute and display the area of the room.

                Athika and Ritu got a nice job at a MNC company .
        
                She was confused with the salary credited in her account.
                
                To verify if the correct amount of HRA and DA was provided to them Ritu and Athika  planned to develop a software that calculates the salary pay if the basic pay was provided.
                
                The Salary policy of Athika and Ritu's Company is as follows:
                
                HRA is 80% of the basic pay and
                
                DA is 40% of basic pay 
                Can you help Ritu and Athika in the software development?
